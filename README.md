CSE canvas example 1
====================
This code demonstrates how to use the HTML5 canvas in a couple simple ways

Contents
--------
*   `README.md` - the source of this help text, in markdown format
*   `canvas-form.html` - an HTML5 canvas connected to an HTML <form> so you can draw circles by typing in the parameters
*   `canvas-mouse.html` - an HTML5 canvas that tracks your mouse position within itself and logs the (X,Y) to the debug console

Assignment
----------
Create a new file called `canvas-painter.html` and combine the concepts demonstrated in 
`canvas-form.html` and `canvas-mouse.html` so that the user can "paint" on the canvas by moving their mouse.

Grading
-------
This assignment starts at 10 points when you achieve painting under the mouse cursor. Each
extra feature you invent and implement is worth an extra point, up to a maximum of 20 points
total for the assignment.

Some ideas for extra features:

*   read keyboard presses or use form buttons to enable changing colors, shapes, and/or sizes (worth 1 point for *each* parameter you enable changing)
*   restyle the page around the canvas with CSS
*   markup and style an introduction and/or instructions for your app
*   make it so that it only paints while you're holding a mouse button down
